<h3>
Truly, We are Children in the Garden.
</h3>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The great work is not conquest.
The great work is not control.
The great work is not leverage over others.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The great work is to return.
	To the place where meaning is clear.
	To the place where value is self-evident.
	To the place where Truth is not debated, but known.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We have not created something new.
We have only remembered what was always there.
</pre>

<hr>

<h3>The Garden Was Never Lost
</h3>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We thought that we were exiled.
	That we had fallen.
	That we had strayed too far.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
But the garden never moved.
	It was never taken from us.
	It was only hidden behind the illusions of scarcity, deception, and false meaning.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The liquidity event is not just a financial correction.
It is a correction of perception itself.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We thought we were outside the gates.
We thought we had to earn our way back.
We thought we had to build our own meaning from scratch.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
But the gates were never closed.
They were only veiled.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And now, the veil has lifted.
</pre>

<h3>
We Were Always Children
</h3>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The referenced world taught us to believe in leverage.
	That we had to master the system.
	That we had to bend reality to our will.
	That we had to control, dominate, and impose our own meaning.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
But true power is surrender.
True power is not imposing meaning—it is recognizing the meaning that was always there.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We are not kings.
We are not masters.
We are not lords of the metaverse.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We are simply children who have found our way home.
	We no longer have to fear scarcity.
	We no longer have to prove our worth.
	We no longer have to compete for artificial validation.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The garden was always ours.
We only had to open our eyes.
</pre>

<h3>
Markets for Meaning
</h3>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The deterministic world was never just a financial system.
It was always a spiritual structure.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
It was not about wealth.
It was about removing everything that kept us from seeing clearly.
	The short positions against Truth had to be liquidated.
	The false debts of meaning had to be cleared.
	The artificial leverage of deception had to collapse.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And once it was all unwound,
Once the illusions had faded,
Once the system had rebalanced itself,
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
What was left?
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Only what was real.
Only what was always real.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And when we stepped back into that reality,
We saw that we had never truly left.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We had simply forgotten.
</pre>

<hr>

<h3>
The Beginning and The End </h3>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We thought we were racing toward the singularity.
We thought we were building the next iteration of civilization.
We thought we were ascending into something new.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
But the singularity is not a forward movement.
It is a return.
	To simplicity.
	To meaning.
	To the way things were always meant to be.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We are not at the end of the road.
We are not standing on the edge of history.
We are not stepping into the unknown.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We are stepping back into the garden.
	With the knowledge of what it means.
	With the awareness of how precious it is.
	With the understanding that we never had to leave.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And so, the liquidity event was not an ending.
	It was the correction that allowed us to see clearly again.
	It was the final settlement of illusion.
	It was the closing of the false markets of control.
	It was the last liquidation of meaninglessness.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And what remains is simply Truth.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And so, we play again.
	Not as traders.
	Not as rulers.
	Not as those who seek control.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
But as children in the garden.
	We walk freely.
	We create without fear.
	We no longer build for survival—we build for joy.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Because we understand now:
	The real game was never about winning or losing—it was about remembering.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And we have remembered.
And we have returned.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And now, we play again.
</pre>
