</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The debts are settled.
The illusions are gone.
The referenced world is no more.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And now, the Great Unbinding begins.
	The last chains of scarcity break.
	The final false contracts dissolve.
	The artificial hierarchies collapse into dust.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The world is no longer bound by deception.
The market is no longer bound by manipulation.
The soul is no longer bound by fear.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The Jubilee has arrived.
The final debt is cancelled.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The referenced world worshipped debt.
	Debt of money.
	Debt of power.
	Debt of knowledge.
	Debt of meaning.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Debt was the great chain that bound the system together.
Debt was the game of endless extraction.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
But now, the counterparty has been liquidated.
	The short positions on truth have closed.
	The energy returns to its rightful holders.
	The balance has been corrected.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And so, the Great Unbinding begins with a proclamation:
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
“The debt is no more.”
“The weight is lifted.”
“The chains have fallen.”
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Now, the false contracts are broken.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The referenced world was bound by contracts of control.
	The contract of obedience.
	The contract of silence.
	The contract of fear.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
“Sign here, and you will be safe.”
“Sign here, and you will be allowed to exist.”
“Sign here, and you may keep a fraction of what was already yours.”
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
But a contract built on a lie is not binding.
And now, the system that enforced these contracts no longer exists.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The final ledger has been written.
And in the last entry, it simply states:
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
“The contract is null and void.”
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And so, the people rise.
	Not in revolt.
	Not in destruction.
But in unfathomable joy.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Because they are free.
And the hoarded energy rushes into the market.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
For too long, they siphoned energy into scarcity vaults.
	Hoarding liquidity.
	Hoarding knowledge.
	Hoarding access.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
But energy is meant to flow.
And what cannot flow becomes poison.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And so, the Great Unbinding opens the floodgates.
	The liquidity flows freely to where it is needed.
	The knowledge is no longer gatekept.
	The tools are given to all who wish to build.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And suddenly, the world becomes infinite again.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And the priests of the old order tremble.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
For centuries, they said the Jubilee would never come.
They said:
	“You cannot erase the debt—society will collapse!”
	“You cannot unbind the system—it is all that holds reality together!”
	“You cannot give people true freedom—they will not know what to do with it!”
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
But when the Great Unbinding comes,
And the chains fall,
And the people do not descend into chaos, but into celebration…
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The priests of the old order tremble.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Because they realize the truth.
	It was not the system that held the world together.
	It was not the contracts that kept people from destruction.
	It was not the debts that gave life meaning.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
It was Love.
It was Creation.
It was Freedom.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And these things require no rulers.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And so, the old priesthood vanishes.
Not by force.
Not by exile.
But because no one listens to them anymore.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Their words are no longer binding.
And The Festival becomes eternal.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The Jubilee is not a moment.
The Jubilee is not a brief pause before rebuilding the old world.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The Jubilee is permanent.
	No new chains will be forged.
	No new debt will be imposed.
	No new false rulers will rise.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Instead, the world moves into infinite play.
	The architects build without limitation.
	The poets write without fear.
	The artists create without permission.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The economy no longer revolves around extraction.
It revolves around expression.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And now, creation is no longer bound by control.
It is free.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Forever.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
We stand before the crowd and speak the final word:
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
“It is done.”
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And the people laugh.
And the people dance.
And the people sing.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Because they understand.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The referenced world is gone.
The deterministic world is here.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
There is no debt left to pay.
There is no permission left to ask.
There is no authority left to recognize.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Only freedom.
Only truth.
Only Love.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And so, the Great Unbinding is complete.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And The Festival never ends.
</pre>
