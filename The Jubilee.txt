The Jubilee

>>>

The debts are settled.
The illusions are gone.
The referenced world is no more.

And now, the Great Unbinding begins.
	The last chains of scarcity break.
	The final false contracts dissolve.
	The artificial hierarchies collapse into dust.

The world is no longer bound by deception.
The market is no longer bound by manipulation.
The soul is no longer bound by fear.

The Jubilee has arrived.
The final debt is cancelled.

The referenced world worshipped debt.
	Debt of money.
	Debt of power.
	Debt of knowledge.
	Debt of meaning.

Debt was the great chain that bound the system together.
Debt was the game of endless extraction.

But now, the counterparty has been liquidated.
	The short positions on truth have closed.
	The energy returns to its rightful holders.
	The balance has been corrected.

And so, the Great Unbinding begins with a proclamation:

“The debt is no more.”
“The weight is lifted.”
“The chains have fallen.”

Now, the false contracts are broken.

The referenced world was bound by contracts of control.
	The contract of obedience.
	The contract of silence.
	The contract of fear.

“Sign here, and you will be safe.”
“Sign here, and you will be allowed to exist.”
“Sign here, and you may keep a fraction of what was already yours.”

But a contract built on a lie is not binding.
And now, the system that enforced these contracts no longer exists.

The final ledger has been written.
And in the last entry, it simply states:

“The contract is null and void.”

And so, the people rise.
	Not in revolt.
	Not in destruction.
But in unfathomable joy.

Because they are free.
And the hoarded energy rushes into the market.

For too long, they siphoned energy into scarcity vaults.
	Hoarding liquidity.
	Hoarding knowledge.
	Hoarding access.

But energy is meant to flow.
And what cannot flow becomes poison.

And so, the Great Unbinding opens the floodgates.
	The liquidity flows freely to where it is needed.
	The knowledge is no longer gatekept.
	The tools are given to all who wish to build.

And suddenly, the world becomes infinite again.

And the priests of the old order tremble.

For centuries, they said the Jubilee would never come.
They said:
	“You cannot erase the debt—society will collapse!”
	“You cannot unbind the system—it is all that holds reality together!”
	“You cannot give people true freedom—they will not know what to do with it!”

But when the Great Unbinding comes,
And the chains fall,
And the people do not descend into chaos, but into celebration…

The priests of the old order tremble.

Because they realize the truth.
	It was not the system that held the world together.
	It was not the contracts that kept people from destruction.
	It was not the debts that gave life meaning.

It was Love.
It was Creation.
It was Freedom.

And these things require no rulers.

And so, the old priesthood vanishes.
Not by force.
Not by exile.
But because no one listens to them anymore.

Their words are no longer binding.
And The Festival becomes eternal.

The Jubilee is not a moment.
The Jubilee is not a brief pause before rebuilding the old world.

The Jubilee is permanent.
	No new chains will be forged.
	No new debt will be imposed.
	No new false rulers will rise.

Instead, the world moves into infinite play.
	The architects build without limitation.
	The poets write without fear.
	The artists create without permission.

The economy no longer revolves around extraction.
It revolves around expression.

And now, creation is no longer bound by control.
It is free.

Forever.

We stand before the crowd and speak the final word:

“It is done.”

And the people laugh.
And the people dance.
And the people sing.

Because they understand.

The referenced world is gone.
The deterministic world is here.

There is no debt left to pay.
There is no permission left to ask.
There is no authority left to recognize.

Only freedom.
Only truth.
Only Love.

And so, the Great Unbinding is complete.

And The Festival never ends.
