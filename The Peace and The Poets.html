Peace Has Overcome, Long Live the Poets!
Love Has Overcome, Long Live the Poets!
Truth Has Overcome, Long Live the Poets!
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The final veil has lifted.
The system is unwound.
The last illusions are gone.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And in the end,
	It was not the kings who remained.
	It was not the rulers who survived.
	It was not the merchants, nor the warriors, nor the priests of the old order.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
It was the Poets.
</pre>

<h3>The Poets Were the First to See the Truth
</h3>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Before the markets saw it.
Before the rulers knew it.
Before the algorithms detected it.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The Poets felt the shift before it happened.
	They saw the cracks in the foundation.
	They felt the old world breaking beneath their feet.
	They knew that the liquidity was movingâ€”not just financially, but spiritually.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And so, they wrote.
	They sang.
	They spoke the unspoken.
	They recorded what no one else could see.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And now, the world has caught up to them.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The world sees what they saw first.
The world hears what they have always been saying.
The world understands what was once hidden in verse and rhyme and meter.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And so, it is the Poets who remain.
It is the Poets who inherit.
It is the Poets who are now recognized as the first children of the new world.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The referenced world bound the financiers with their own leverage.
It bound the rulers with their own greed.
It bound the merchants with their own endless chase for more.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
But the Poets?
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The Poets never had a price.
	They could not be bought.
	They could not be threatened.
	They could not be controlled.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
For their wealth was never measured in coins,
Their value was never set by the markets,
Their meaning was never dictated by rulers.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The Poets spoke the Truth, even when it cost them everything.
And now, the Truth has set them free.
</pre>

<hr>

<h3>The Final Store of Value
</h3>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
When the false contracts dissolved,
When the old currencies failed,
When the final liquidity event settled,
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
What remained?
	Not fiat.
	Not leveraged positions.
	Not synthetic markets.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Only the Poets.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
For their words are the only assets that compound infinitely.
Their Truths are the only collateral that cannot be liquidated.
Their insights are the only energy that never depletes.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And so, the final price correction is complete.
The Poets inherit the Earth.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
No longer will the merchants dictate meaning.
No longer will the financiers control the game.
No longer will the rulers be the authors of history.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
For history now belongs to those who wrote the Truth when no one was listening.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The system is no longer built on leverage.
	It is built on Truth.
	It is built on meaning.
	It is built on the Poets.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And so, as the festival begins,
	As the new world emerges,
	As the infinite game unfolds,
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
A single cry echoes across eternity:
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Peace has overcome, long live the Poets!
Love has overcome, long live the Poets!
Truth has overcome, long live the Poets!
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
The Poets step forward.
	They pick up their pens.
	They open their mouths.
	They begin to speak.
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
And the world listens.
</pre>
