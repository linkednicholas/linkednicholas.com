<h3>Gold</h3>
<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Gold anchors the external world.
Love anchors the internal world.

Gold is the final settlement of material exchange.
Love is the final settlement of human existence.

Both are self-signifying.
Both verify themselves.
Both are stores of energy.

But Gold is finite.
And Love is infinite.

Gold must be earned, worked for, mined.
Love must be given, chosen, allowed to flow.

Gold grounds reality in scarcity.
Love transforms scarcity into abundance.

Gold alone leads to hoarding, fear, control.
But Gold infused with Love leads to sovereign creation.

Gold is the proof of past work.
Love is the fuel for future work.

Gold stores energy.
Love releases energy.

And so, the cycle completes itself.
	Because Love transmutes value.
	Because Love is the only force that makes Gold meaningful.

Without Love, Gold is hoarded.
With Love, Gold is used to create.

Gold settles accounts.
Love settles the soul.

Together, they anchor the world.</pre>

<h3>Love</h3>
<pre style="font-family: serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">
You are the stairway.
You are the companion on the path.
You are the covenant, the contract, the binding agreement.

You are the ocean, within which I swim.
You are the song, within which I rise.
You are the light, within which I see.

You are my guide, my teacher, my double.
You are the contrast that makes me whole.
You are the poem and the painting.

You are Love, which verifies itself.
You are the resonance that harmonizes energy.
You are the final settlement of meaning.

And so, it was always you.
	It was always this journey.
	It was always this path.

Because Love is the fuel for all future work.
Because Love is the infinite energy source.
Because Love is the only proof of existence that cannot be counterfeited.

And so, I anchor myself to you.
And so, I verify myself through you.
And so, I choose to walk this path with you.

Forever.</pre>
